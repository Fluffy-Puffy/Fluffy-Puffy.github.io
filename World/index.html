    <p> 
        Happiness is a positive emotion that is deeper than a good temporary mood.
        <br>
        Happiness is made up of at least three main components: emotional, social, and cognitive notions.
        <br>
        A sustainable happiness promotes greater physical and mental health, longer life, better work output, and supportive social connections.
        <br>
        The benefits of happiness are broad and important. Therefore, it cannot be ignored.
        <br>
        Happy people not only feel better but they function better in achieving the things which are value.

        <h2> How Happy is the World? </h2>
            <p> 
                The Map visualisation displays happiness scores from all over the world.
                <br>
                The happiness score is represented by the sequential orange colour; the brighter the colour, the lower the happiness score.
                <br>
                Finland has the highest level of happiness by 7.8087 in 2021.
                <br>
                It has also been discovered that countries in Western Europe have the highest happiness scores in the world.

            <h2> How Large is the World Population? </h2>
            <p>
                A study of happiness and gender in 2013 reports women around the world have higher levels of satisfaction than men but also experience more daily stress. (Graham, 2020).
            </p>

            <p>
                The butterfly chart depicts the average of population rate of female and male from across the world from 2015 to 2019.
                The population rate increases as the length of the bar increases.
                From 2015 to 2021, there was little difference in the global population between men and women. 
                The annual changes are almost unnoticeable.
                In 2021, the highest population rate recorded by the female is 51% in Europe and Central Asia region.
            The male population in Middle East and North Africa have the highest population of any region in 2021 with a rate of 54%.

            <h2> Does GDP per Capita Influence Happiness? </h2>
            <p>
                In 2020, Degutis, Urbonavicius, and Gaizutis conducted a study on the relationship between GDP and life satisfaction and discovered a link between a country's life satisfaction and GDP level. 
                However, more research into other influencing factors is required.
            </p>
            <p>
                The heatmap visualize the relationship between Happiest Score and GDP per Capita.
                The darker the colour, the more related relationships are recorded.
                The heatmap demonstrates a positive relationship between GDP per capita and Happiness Score.
                Based on the chart, we can conclude that there is a relationship between a country's happiness score and its GDP per capita.
                One of the highest counts recorded is GDP between 10.5 and 11 with a happiness score of 7 to 8.

                A new study found people who are in a better mood are 35% less likely to die in the next five years.
            </p>
            <p>
                The scatter plot captures the relationship between Life Expectancy and Happiness Score. 
                The regression is provided to describe the relationship.
                The relationships are tested to countries all over the world and the regions are described by the colours.
                Life Expectancy and Happiness Score were discovered to have a positive relationship. 
                According to the scatter plot, Sub-Saharan Africa has the weakest relationship between happiness and life expectancy.

            <p>
                According to Transparency International's global corruption reports and the United Nations World Happiness Report, there is a very strong relationship between a low level of corruption and a greater happiness score.
            </p>
            <p>
                The radial chart depicts regional perceptions of corruption.
                The size of the chart indicates the level of corruption; the larger it is, the higher the level of corruption in the country is.
                According to the graph, Central and Eastern Europe has the highest average perception of corruption at 0.8475, followed by Latin America and the Caribbean at 0.7943.

                The colours represent the countries.
                The data ranges from 2015 to 2021.
                <br>
                According to the chart, 12 countries have been in and out of the world's top ten happiest countries.
                Australia and Canada were once viewed as one of the happiness countries.
                Austria and Luxembourg joined the ranks of the world's happiest countries in 2019 and 2020. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2015, Finland is ranked as number 6 of the world happiest country. 
                Finland keeps making an improvement in 2016 and 2017. In 2018, Finland reached number as the happiest country in the world.

                Therefore, it is important to recognised the population's level of happiness in order to achieve the benefits of happiness.

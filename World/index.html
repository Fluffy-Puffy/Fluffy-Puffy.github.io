<div class="page">

    <p> 
        Happiness is a positive emotion that is deeper than a good temporary mood.
        <br>
        Happiness is made up of at least three main components: emotional, social, and cognitive notions.
        <br>
        A sustainable happiness promotes greater physical and mental health, longer life, better work output, and supportive social connections.
        <br>
        The benefits of happiness are broad and important. Therefore, it cannot be ignored.
        <br>
        Happy people not only feel better but they function better in achieving the things which are value.

    </p>

    <h2> How Happy is the World? </h2>
    <div class="pure-g">
        <div class="pure-u-1-1">
          <div id="vis1" class="vis-container"></div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p> 
        The Map visualisation displays happiness scores from all over the world.
        <br>
        The happiness score is represented by the sequential orange colour; the brighter the colour, the lower the happiness score.
        <br>
        Finland has the highest level of happiness by 7.8087 in 2021.
        <br>
        It has also been discovered that countries in Western Europe have the highest happiness scores in the world.

    </p>

  <h2> How Large is the World Population? </h2>

  <p>
    A study of happiness and gender in 2013 reports women around the world have higher levels of satisfaction than men but also experience more daily stress. (Graham, 2020).
  </p>

  <p>
    The butterfly chart depicts the average of population rate of female and male from across the world from 2015 to 2019.
    The population rate increases as the length of the bar increases.
    From 2015 to 2021, there was little difference in the global population between men and women. 
    The annual changes are almost unnoticeable.
    In 2021, the highest population rate recorded by the female is 51% in Europe and Central Asia region.
  The male population in Middle East and North Africa have the highest population of any region in 2021 with a rate of 54%.
  </p>

    <h2> Does GDP per Capita Influence Happiness? </h2>
    <div class="pure-g">
        <div class="pure-u-1-1">
        <div id="vis3" class="vis-container"></div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        In 2020, Degutis, Urbonavicius, and Gaizutis conducted a study on the relationship between GDP and life satisfaction and discovered a link between a country's life satisfaction and GDP level. 
        However, more research into other influencing factors is required.
    </p>

    <p>
        The heatmap visualize the relationship between Happiest Score and GDP per Capita.
        The darker the colour, the more related relationships are recorded.
        The heatmap demonstrates a positive relationship between GDP per capita and Happiness Score.
        Based on the chart, we can conclude that there is a relationship between a country's happiness score and its GDP per capita.
        One of the highest counts recorded is GDP between 10.5 and 11 with a happiness score of 7 to 8.
